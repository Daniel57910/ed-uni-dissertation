numpy arange for next session
setup location based on incentive placement

Q1:

investigate:
    simulation end at 50%
    likelihood returning = pdf(
        loc=incentive_time,
        scale=incentive_time * .75
    ).cdf(simulation_time) 

    3 possible incentives and conditions 
    conditons:
        1st placed before 50% of session: random noise reduction (-0.05 - 0)
        2nd (placed after ): random noise reduction (-0.15 - -0.1)
        3rd (placed after ) of session: random noise reduction (-0.25 - -0.15)


after 75 minutes it is expected that user has motivation beyond incentives and will continue
